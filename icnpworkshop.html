    The HDR-Nets workshop focuses on the application of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Big Idea in the networking domain, particularly on the design, deployment, operation and management, and evolution of networking systems and services. This first-year workshop aims to bring together industrial practitioners and academic researchers to share ideas and visions on harnessing the latest data science and engineering technologies to solve the problems and challenges that network and service providers face today and in the near future. The workshop will feature technical sessions and invited speakers on these topics. Participants will gain in-depth understanding of the challenges in creating next-generation networking technologies, in managing increasingly large and complex networking systems, and in delivering highly reliable and high-performing networked services that meet users’ ever-rising expectations. This workshop will open the dialogue and promote participants to form collaborations in creating innovative solutions to address those challenges, as well as validating and driving technology adoption in operational environment.

                        With 5G and Wi-Fi 6 deployments rolling out a natural question that arises is what are the
                        frontiers of research in wireless networking today? This talk will outline some of the long-term
                        research areas that are of interest for the National Science Foundation: machine learning for
                        networking, platforms for experimental research and THz communication being a few.

                        She joined NSF as a Program Director in September 2017, in the Directorate of
                        Computer & Information Science and Engineering (CISE). She manages wireless
                        networking research within the Networking Technologies and Systems (NeTS) program at
                        NSF. Dr. Ghosh is a Research Professor at the University of Chicago, with a joint
                        appointment at the Argonne National Laboratories, where she conducts research on
                        wireless technologies for the IoT, 5G cellular, next generation Wi-Fi systems and
                        machine learning for predictive oncology. Prior to joining the University of Chicago
                        in September 2015, she worked at Interdigital, Philips Research and Bell
                        Laboratories, on various wireless systems such as the HDTV broadcast standard, cable

                        Electrical Engineering and CS at MIT.
                        <br/>
                        He is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), reserved for
                        approximately the top 1% of all professionals in computer science, recognizing his
                        work on data-driven approaches (including machine learning) to Internet security and
                        performance.
                        <br/>
                        He has extensive experience with technical and legal consulting, as a technical and

                        technologies.
                        <br/>
                        In the 1990s, Feamster was one of the first software engineers at LookSmart, a
                        directory-based Internet search engine later bought by AltaVista. His work on
                        Internet codecs and streaming protocols in the late 1990s led to the development of
                        one of the first real-time video transcoding algorithms, and one of the first
                        streaming video systems to transmit live television over the Internet. In the 2000s,
                        Feamster worked at AT&T to design and implement the Intelligent Route Control
                        Service Point (IRSCP), a precursor to Software Defined Networking (SDN).
                        <br/>
                        In 2008, he received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and
                        Engineers (PECASE) for his contributions to cybersecurity. His other honors include
                        the Technology Review 35 "Top Young Innovators Under 35" award, a Sloan Research
                        Fellowship, the NSF CAREER award, and award papers at SIGCOMM, NSDI, and USENIX

                        <b>Abstract:</b> Networking research in the era of AI/ML is experiencing a growing chasm between a select few groups of researchers in industry and the large number of academic researchers. While the former can leverage access to their global-scale production networks in their data-driven efforts to develop and evaluate new learning models, the latter not only struggle to get their hands on real-world data sets but find it almost impossible to adequately train and evaluate their learning models under realistic conditions. This talk outlines a vision for democratizing networking research in the era of AI/ML and defines a research agenda for creating a more level playing field for academic researchers.

<span>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies have achieved remarkable success nowadays in many application domains, e.g., natural language processing, voice recognition, and computer vision. Meanwhile, the ever increasing complexity and scale of today’s networks keep posing new challenges for network measurement and analysis techniques and tools. Advances in the CPU/GPU performance and progress in ML methods—particularly using neural networks—have made ML/AI capable of shedding light on the enormous amount of operational and systems data. Therefore, AI/ML has been effectively used in many critical networking data analytic functions, such as fault isolation, intrusion detection, event correlation, log analysis, capacity planning, and design optimization, just to name a few.
<br><br>
Moreover, networking has recently undergone a huge transformation enabled by new models resulting from softwarization, virtualization, and cloud computing. This has led to a number of novel architectures supported by emerging technologies such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), edge computing, IoT, and 5G. On the other hand, maturing ML techniques, such as reinforcement learning and transfer learning, can potentially serve as basis for incorporating learning into automated network control. The emergence of enhanced design coupled with the increased complexity in networking systems and protocols has fueled the need for improved network autonomy in agile infrastructures, which can be combined with AI/ML techniques to execute efficient, rapid, trustworthy management operations. For example, the coupling of the programmable control of SDN with scientific innovations in AI/ML promises unprecedented opportunities for querying high-volume and high-velocity, distributed streaming data at scale. This new technical capability can provide the necessary information to the many different network monitoring and control tasks to enable efficient automation of autonomous networks .

The above directions can be seen to collectively fall into the National Science Foundations’ (NSF) Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Big Idea, a national-scale activity to enable new modes of data-driven discovery that will allow new fundamental questions to be addressed at the frontiers of science and engineering, with the focus in computer and communication networks. In this workshop, we invite submissions of high-quality original technical and survey papers, which have not been published previously, on artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques and their applications to computer and communication networks, including but not limited to following topics:</span>
